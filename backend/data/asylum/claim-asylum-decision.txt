------------------------------------

Get a decision

Your application will be decided as soon as possible.

It may take longer if your case is complicated. This can happen if:
- supporting documents need verification
- additional interviews are required
- personal circumstances need checking (for example criminal conviction or prosecution)

You can ask your legal adviser if you want an update on your application.

------------------------------------

Possible outcomes of your asylum decision

You will either:
- be given permission to stay in the UK
- be refused permission to stay

------------------------------------

Permission to stay if you have refugee status or humanitarian protection

Refugee status means you are recognised as a refugee under the Refugee Convention.

You may receive humanitarian protection if:
- you do not qualify for refugee status
- you cannot safely return to your country

------------------------------------

What you’ll get if protection is granted

If you are granted refugee status or humanitarian protection:
- you will usually receive permission to stay in the UK for at least 5 years
- you may apply for a refugee integration loan
- after 5 years, you may apply to settle permanently in the UK

------------------------------------

Your partner and children under 18

If your dependants are included in your application:
- they will usually receive permission to stay for 5 years
- they can apply to settle in the UK after 5 years as part of the family

Dependants do not automatically receive refugee status or humanitarian protection unless they make their own asylum claim.

Dependants may apply for a refugee integration loan if you are granted refugee status or humanitarian protection.

------------------------------------

Permission to stay for other reasons

You may receive permission to stay for other reasons if:
- you do not qualify for refugee status
- you do not qualify for humanitarian protection

The length of stay depends on your situation.

You may be able to:
- apply to extend your stay
- apply to settle in the UK later

------------------------------------

No reason to stay in the UK

You will be asked to leave the UK if:
- you do not qualify for refugee status
- your caseworker decides there is no other reason for you to stay

You may be able to appeal the decision.

------------------------------------

If your appeal is unsuccessful or not submitted

You must leave the UK if:
- you do not appeal within the allowed time
- your appeal is unsuccessful

You may:
- leave voluntarily (support may be available for returning home)
- be forced to leave

If you are forced to leave:
- you will receive a letter before removal
- you may be detained at an immigration removal centre without warning
- you may then be removed from the UK
