ASYLUM SUPPORT IN THE UK – HOUSING AND MONEY OVERVIEW

This text gives general information about asylum support in the UK. It does not replace official guidance and is not legal advice.

1. What is asylum support?

Asylum support is basic help from the UK government for people who have claimed asylum and cannot support themselves. It is usually managed by the Home Office. Support can include:

- Shared accommodation in a dispersal area.
- A small weekly cash allowance on a payment card.
- Access to free NHS healthcare.
- School places for children.

2. Who can get asylum support?

In simple terms, a person may qualify if:

- They have an outstanding asylum claim or appeal.
- They do not have enough money to meet basic needs.
- They do not have suitable accommodation.

The exact rules are set out in legislation and Home Office policy. There are different types of support for:

- People waiting for an initial decision.
- People who have been refused but are not yet leaving the UK.
- Some families with children.
- Some people with special needs.

3. How to apply for asylum support

Usually a person fills in an application form and sends supporting documents about their situation. The application can ask about:

- Where they are staying now.
- Whether they can stay with friends or family.
- What money or savings they have.
- Any health needs.
- Any children or dependants.

The Home Office then decides if they qualify and what type of support they can get.

4. Accommodation

If asylum support is granted, the person is usually given accommodation somewhere in the UK, not always in the city where they claimed asylum. They normally cannot choose where to live. Accommodation can be:

- A room in a shared house.
- A hotel or hostel type building.
- Other contracted housing.

Family members are usually kept together. Single people often share with strangers.

5. Cash allowance

Along with accommodation, the person may receive a small weekly cash amount on a payment card. This is meant to cover items like:

- Food and basic drinks.
- Toiletries and cleaning products.
- Clothing and small personal items.
- Phone credit or data.

The rate can change over time and is usually lower than mainstream welfare benefits.

6. Healthcare and education

Asylum seekers who receive support can normally:

- Register with a GP and get free NHS treatment.
- Get emergency and maternity care.
- Enrol their children in a state school.

Some extra support may exist for pregnant people and young children.

7. Support after a refusal

If an asylum claim is fully refused, standard support may stop. In some cases, a person can apply for limited support while they prepare to leave the UK or if there is a temporary barrier to return. The rules are strict and depend on individual circumstances and current Home Office policy.

8. Important warnings

- Rules for asylum support can change.
- This text is not a full description of all support types.
