Voluntary return overview

You can get help to return to your home country if you do not have permission to remain in the UK. This is known as voluntary return.

------------------------------------

Support available through voluntary return service

If you are eligible, the voluntary returns service can:
- explain your options for returning home
- help you get travel documents such as a passport
- pay for travel tickets if you cannot afford them

------------------------------------

Financial support

You may be eligible to apply for financial support of up to £3,000.

This support may be used to:
- find accommodation
- find employment
- start a business in your home country

Coming back to the UK

You may not be able to return to the UK for a period of time after leaving. This is known as a re-entry ban.

The length of the ban depends on:
- your immigration history
- how much support you received from the Home Office when leaving

Re-entry advice

You can contact an immigration adviser for guidance about re-entry bans before applying to return to the UK.
