ASLYUM PROCESS IN THE UK – HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

This text gives a plain language overview of the asylum process in the UK. It is not legal advice. It is general information based mainly on public guidance from the UK government.

1. What does claiming asylum mean?

Claiming asylum means asking the UK to recognise you as a refugee because you fear serious harm in your home country. You must have left your country and you must not be able to return safely.

2. When should someone claim asylum?

The official guidance says you should claim asylum as soon as you arrive in the UK or as soon as you realise it is unsafe to go back to your country. Waiting a long time without a good reason can make the Home Office more likely to refuse the claim.

3. First step: making the claim and screening

When you claim asylum you will have a short first meeting with an immigration officer. This is called a screening interview. In the screening:

- They check your identity details and fingerprints.
- They ask about your journey to the UK.
- They ask basic questions about why you are afraid to return.
- They check if you have family members with you.

You should tell the truth and give clear information, even if you are stressed or tired. The screening is not the full asylum interview, but it becomes part of your file.

4. Second step: deciding where the claim will be considered

After the screening, the Home Office decides if your case will be considered in the UK or in another country. They may try to send the case to a “safe third country” if they think you passed through a country where you could have asked for asylum.

If the claim stays in the UK, the Home Office gives the case to a caseworker.

5. Caseworker and reporting

You are normally given a named caseworker. The caseworker:

- Explains the process.
- Sends you letters and decisions.
- Invites you to the main asylum interview.

You may also have to go to regular reporting appointments. If you miss reporting without a good reason, the Home Office can treat your claim as withdrawn or can detain you.

6. Main asylum interview

The main interview is usually much longer than the screening. In this interview, the caseworker asks detailed questions about:

- Your background.
- What happened to you.
- Why you are afraid to return.
- Any threats from the authorities or other groups.
- Any documents or evidence that support your story.

You can ask for an interpreter. You can also ask for a legal representative to be present, but legal aid is not always available in practice.

7. After the interview and decision

After the main interview the Home Office decides whether to:

- Grant refugee status.
- Grant humanitarian protection or another type of leave.
- Refuse the claim.

If they grant status, you normally receive permission to stay in the UK for a number of years and you can later apply for settlement if the rules are met.

If they refuse, you might have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal. There are time limits for an appeal and the rules can change, so it is important to check current guidance or speak to an adviser.

8. Support during the process

While you wait for the decision you may be able to get asylum support, which can include basic accommodation and a small cash payment. You are normally not allowed to work, except in limited situations.

This text is only a simplified introduction. The real process is more complex and the rules can change. Always check up to date official information.
