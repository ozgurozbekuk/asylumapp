Eligibility

To stay in the UK as a refugee you must be unable to live safely in any part of your own country because you fear persecution there.

If you’re stateless, your own country is the country you usually live in.

This persecution must be because of:
- your race
- your religion
- your nationality
- your political opinion
- anything else that puts you at risk because of the social, cultural, religious or political situation in your country, for example, your gender, gender identity or sexual orientation

You must have failed to get protection from authorities in your own country.

------------------------------------

When your claim might not be considered

Your claim might not be considered if you:
- are from an EU country
- travelled to the UK through a ‘safe third country’
- have a connection to a safe third country where you could claim asylum

Generally, a safe third country is one that:
- you’re not a citizen of
- you would not be harmed in
- would not send you on to another country where you would be harmed

------------------------------------

Family members

You can include your partner and your children under 18 as ‘dependants’ in your application if they’re with you in the UK.

If your application is successful, any dependants named on it can usually stay for the same amount of time as you. They will not get refugee status unless they make their own claim for asylum.

------------------------------------

Refugee status

Refugee status means someone is protected by the Refugee Convention.
