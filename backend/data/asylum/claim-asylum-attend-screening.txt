Attend an asylum screening

You register your asylum claim at a ‘screening’. This is a meeting with an immigration officer where you tell them about your case.

You’ll have your screening at the UK border if you claim asylum as soon as you arrive. You can also be screened once you’re in the UK if you become eligible for asylum.

------------------------------------

What happens at your screening

At your screening you’ll:
- be photographed
- have your fingerprints taken
- have an interview to check who you are and where you’re from

You’ll be asked why you want asylum. You can bring written evidence to support your claim if you want, as well as any other documents you need.

You’ll need to say if you or your dependants are taking any medication and give any relevant medical information. A dependant is your partner and any children under 18.

You can ask for a male or female interviewer, but your choice might not always be available.

------------------------------------

Screening at the UK border

You must tell a Border Force officer that you want to claim asylum.

Your application will be registered and you’ll be screened. Ask for an interpreter if you need one.

------------------------------------

Screening if you’re already in the UK

Call the asylum registration appointment line to book a screening appointment.

When you call, you’ll be asked simple questions about:
- you
- your family
- your housing arrangements

If you have nowhere to live, you still need to call the asylum registration appointment line. You may be told to attend a screening appointment.

You will not be asked why you’re claiming asylum during this call.

------------------------------------

Tell the appointment line if

Tell the asylum registration appointment line if:
- you need to bring any dependants to your screening appointment
- you’re a child and need to be accompanied
- you need an interpreter at your screening appointment

------------------------------------

Important screening rules

Your asylum claim is not registered until:
- you attend your screening appointment
- your application has been accepted

Do not attend an asylum registration location without a screening appointment. If the location does not know you’re coming, you may not be seen.

------------------------------------

Attending your screening appointment

You can bring:
- a legal representative
- an interpreter

You must bring:
- any dependants who are claiming asylum with you
- documents needed for your application

If you’re helping a child register their own asylum claim, you can go with them to their screening appointment.

You cannot get financial help for travel to or from the asylum registration location.

------------------------------------

Changes before your appointment

Tell the appointment service if your situation changes before your appointment date, for example if you can no longer stay where you are living.
