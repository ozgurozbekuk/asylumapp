------------------------------------

After your screening

After your screening, the Home Office will review your case and decide whether it can be considered in the UK.

You’ll be sent an asylum registration card (ARC) to your UK address, unless you’ve been detained.

If the Home Office cannot send you an ARC immediately, they’ll send you an appointment letter telling you what to do next.

------------------------------------

If your case cannot be considered in the UK

You may be sent to a safe country that will consider your asylum claim.

A safe country is one that:
- you’re not a citizen of
- you would not be harmed in
- would not send you to another unsafe country

------------------------------------

Caseworkers

You may have an asylum interview with your caseworker.

You must attend reporting events.

If you miss them:
- claim may be withdrawn
- detention risk

------------------------------------

Your ARC

The ARC proves you applied for asylum.

You can use it to:
- confirm identity
- show work permission
- access services

------------------------------------

Being detained

You may be detained in an immigration removal centre while waiting for decision.
