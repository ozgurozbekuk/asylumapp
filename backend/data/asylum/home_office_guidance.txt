HOME OFFICE ROLE IN THE ASYLUM SYSTEM – INFORMATION ONLY

This text explains in simple language what the Home Office does in an asylum case. It is based on public government information and is not legal advice.

1. Who is the Home Office in an asylum case?

In the UK, the Home Office is the government department that deals with immigration, asylum and borders. Caseworkers and immigration officers who handle an asylum claim work for the Home Office.

2. What does the Home Office check?

When someone claims asylum, the Home Office will normally check:

- Identity and nationality.
- Travel history and which countries the person passed through.
- Whether the person has claimed asylum in another country.
- Whether the person has a criminal record.
- Whether the story is consistent and supported by evidence.

They compare what you say at the screening interview, the main interview and in any written statements or documents.

3. Home Office guidance for caseworkers

Home Office caseworkers use large internal guidance documents. These documents explain:

- How to run asylum interviews fairly.
- How to assess credibility.
- How to look at risk on return for different countries.
- How to handle claims from children and vulnerable people.
- How to decide if someone qualifies for refugee status or another form of protection.
- How to grant or refuse support such as housing and cash.

These documents do not replace the law, but they show how the Home Office applies the law in practice.

4. Caseworker decisions

At the end of the process, the Home Office caseworker must decide:

- Does this person meet the definition of a refugee?
- If not, are they still at real risk of serious harm if sent back?
- If there is no protection need, are there any other reasons to grant leave?
- If they refuse protection, is there a right of appeal?

The decision letter should explain why they accepted or rejected parts of the story, what country information they used and which legal tests they applied.

5. Safe third country and inadmissibility

The Home Office may decide that a claim is “inadmissible” if they think another country should look at it. This can happen when:

- The person already claimed asylum in a different safe country.
- The person has a close connection to another safe country.
- The person passed through a country that is considered safe and did not claim asylum there.

If a claim is treated as inadmissible, the Home Office can try to send the person to that other country. If they cannot arrange this, they may later consider the claim in the UK.

6. Detention and reporting

The Home Office can detain some people in immigration removal centres, including some asylum seekers, for example:

- At the start or end of their case.
- If they think the person might abscond.
- If they plan to remove the person from the UK.

They can also require regular reporting, where the person must attend an immigration reporting centre in person.

7. Reviews, appeals and further submissions

If the Home Office refuses protection, in many cases the person can appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. The tribunal is separate from the Home Office and should be independent. If new evidence appears later, the person may be able to make “further submissions”, sometimes called a “fresh claim”.

8. Limits of this text

This is only a high level, simplified description of how Home Office guidance and practice fits into the asylum system. The real rules are detailed and can change. For concrete legal advice, a person should speak to a regulated immigration adviser.
