------------------------------------

Asylum interview

Your asylum interview will usually take place soon after your screening.

You may be granted protection status without having to attend an interview. This can happen if there is enough evidence from your screening and your questionnaire, if you completed one.

------------------------------------

When an interview might not be required

Protection status may be granted without an interview if sufficient evidence already exists from:
- your screening
- your asylum questionnaire

------------------------------------

Missing your asylum interview

Your application will usually be withdrawn if you do not attend your asylum interview.

You will need to apply again if you still want to stay in the UK.

You will receive a letter telling you:
- when to attend
- where to attend

If your dependants (partner or children under 18) are included in your application, they may also need to attend. The letter will confirm this.

------------------------------------

The interview

You will usually be interviewed alone, without your family members.

An interpreter will be provided if needed.

The information you provide will be confidential and will not be shared with authorities in your home country.

------------------------------------

What you should explain during the interview

Use the interview to explain:
- how you were persecuted in your country
- why you are afraid to return

You may be asked difficult or sensitive questions. It is important to explain fully what happened to you and your family.

You must tell the caseworker everything you want them to consider. Missing information may negatively affect your application.

------------------------------------

Interview record and recordings

The caseworker will make notes during the interview in a document called an “interview record”.

You will receive:
- a copy of the interview record
- an audio recording of the interview (most interviews are conducted via video call)

------------------------------------

Evidence you’ll need

You should send the following identity documents to the Home Office by post, if you have them:
- birth certificate
- passport
- national ID card

Original documents must be sent, not copies.

You should also send identity documents for any dependants included in your application.

------------------------------------

Home Office postal address

UK Visas and Immigration  
PO Box 7782  
Village Way  
Bilston  
WV1 9QB  

------------------------------------

Additional evidence

You should email:
- evidence of persecution
- any other supporting evidence

Email:
asylumcentralcommunicationshub@homeoffice.gov.uk

If you cannot send evidence before the interview, you must send it afterwards. The caseworker may request additional evidence after your interview.

------------------------------------

Legal representative

You can bring a legal representative to the interview, such as:
- a lawyer
- a solicitor

Your interview will still take place if your legal representative is not present.

You cannot delay your interview to arrange legal representation.
