If you're under 18

This information applies to children applying for asylum independently.

If you have an adult relative who is claiming asylum, you should usually apply as part of that relative’s application instead.

If you are not in the care of social services:
- you should use the walk-in service at the asylum intake unit

If you have an adult legally responsible for you

The adult responsible for your care must attend the walk-in service with you.

If you are living with multiple relatives:
- the closest blood relative willing to take responsibility must attend

The responsible adult must provide:
- proof of address
- photo identification (passport or driving licence)

------------------------------------
